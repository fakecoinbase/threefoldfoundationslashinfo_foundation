# Project: ThreeFold Foundation (Grid)

![](foundation_globe.jpg)

The ThreeFold Grid is an infrastructure empowering a new and democratized digital economy based on our values of equality (of access), autonomy, and environmental sustainability. It is the foundation of the new internet, and makes everything else possible.

### Purpose

Today's Internet faces many challenges. It is not acceptable that we leave billions behind without access to the Internet. It is not acceptable that we do not own our own data. And it is not acceptable that the Internet today uses up to 10% of the world's energy. We are creating a better internet infrastructure that is more energy-efficient, secure, reliable, accessible, and where people own their own data. And it is time the world knows about us.

### Status Today

- Today the ThreeFold Grid is live with more than 80,000,000 GB of capacity and 20,000 CPU cores across 20+ countries
- We have recently launched v2.0 of the technology and have migrated existing farmers
- We have some amazing partners and projects ready to host on the grid, and we are seeking more
- We are seeking the expansion of the grid, especially to emerging markets where it is needed most

ThreeFold is also part of the [Conscious Internet Alliance](https://www.consciousinternet.org/index.html#/projects/planed).
